# Clock Web Application

This is a simple web-based clock application built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The project is bundled using **Webpack** to optimize and minimize assets for production use.

## Features

- Displays the current time in **HH:MM:SS** format.
- Supports both **AM/PM** display.
- Bundles and minifies CSS and JavaScript files using **Webpack**.

## Project Structure

```

├── dist/                  # Output directory for build files (bundle.js, style.css, index.html)
├── src/                   # Source files for development (index.html, main.js, style.css)
│   ├── index.html         # HTML template
│   ├── main.js            # JavaScript logic

```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <project-folder>
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Development Setup

### Running the Development Server

To start the development server and see the app in action:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will run a local server on `http://localhost:3000` and automatically open the browser.

### Building for Production

To bundle and optimize the project for production (minifying JavaScript and CSS):

```bash
npm run build
```

This will generate the optimized files in the `dist/` folder, which can be deployed to a live server.

## Webpack Configuration

- **Entry Point**: `src/main.js`
- **Output**: `dist/bundle.js`
- **CSS Extraction**: The `style.css` file is extracted using the `MiniCssExtractPlugin` and placed in the `dist` folder.
- **Minification**: Both JavaScript and CSS are minified using **TerserPlugin** and **CssMinimizerPlugin**.

## Dependencies

- `html-webpack-plugin`: Generates the HTML file and injects the necessary scripts and CSS.
- `mini-css-extract-plugin`: Extracts CSS from JavaScript and outputs it as a separate file.
- `css-loader`: Loads and processes CSS files.
- `css-minimizer-webpack-plugin`: Minifies the CSS in production mode.
- `terser-webpack-plugin`: Minifies the JavaScript in production mode.
- `webpack`: Bundles JavaScript, CSS, and other files.
- `webpack-dev-server`: Serves the application in development mode.
